Movgrab currently supports http and ssltunnel proxys. These an either be set using the -p/-proxy command-line switches, or using the http_proxy and sshtunnel_proxy environment variables.

proxy URLs have the form:

	<type>://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>

If no authentication is needed to use the proxy then the '<username>:<password>@' section can be ommited. 

'type' can be:
	http				A standard http proxy
	https				An http proxy that uses encrypted connections (so is running on port 443 with native ssl)
	httpc				An http proxy that the HTTP/1.1 'CONNECT' method
	socks4      A socks4 proxy (openssh or tor using proxy)
	socks5			A socks5 proxy

All connections will then be forwarded through the proxy.

This is particularly useful in combination with ssh. The ssh command:

	ssh -D *:5050 user@myhost

will connect to 'myhost' and open a socks4/socks5 proxy service locally on port 5050. Movgrab can then be told:

	movgrab -p 127.0.0.1:5050 http://www.youtube.com/?watch=ejfelefffDD

and all it's communications will be routed through ssh and appear to come from 'myhost'.
